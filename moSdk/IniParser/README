V1.0.0:
	Create this project for parsing a ini file.
	The ini is in stantard format, include section, attributes, comments. The section must be in "[]", attributes must be like "key=value", comments must be starts with ";".
	The section cannot be duplicated;
	The key in a section cannot be duplicated;
	In one moment, just one ini file can be parsed, if want to parse another one, should do Uninit to release this file resource firstly.

	Bug I know : cannot being used in multi-threads;

V1.0.1:
	Modify APIs, when init, input a filepath, and will return a list of info;
	This can assure safe when some callers use this lib at the same time, and assure threads-safe;

	Feature I want: use a tree to save all info, donot a list. this will better.
	
V1.0.2:
