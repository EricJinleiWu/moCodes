V1.0.0
    EricWu, 
        create RC4 algo, can do encrypt and decrypt with RC4 to a string;
    
V1.0.1
    EricWu, 
        To RC4 algo, support do crypt to file;
        and do crypt in blockes, the block has length with 1024(bytes), this can be better when string is long or file size is large.

V1.1.0
    EricWu, 20170214
        create MD5 algo, can get MD5 value to the input string;

V1.1.1
    EricWu, 20170215
        Modify MD5 algo, can get md5 value for an input file, too.

V1.2.0
    EricWu, 20170223
        create base64 algo, can do encrypt and decrypt to the input string;
        Feature need add : do crypt to file with this algo.

V1.2.1
    EricWu, 20170226
	Debug for moCrypt_BASE64_Chars, and modify some bug in this funciton;
        Feature need add : do crypt to file with this algo.

V1.2.2
    EricWu, 20170302
    Add a feature : moCrypt-BASE64, can do crypt to file.

V1.2.3
    EricWu, 20170303
    Change logger method from printf to moLogger.

V1.2.4
    EricWu, 20170314
    Modify some warnings being found when make;

V1.2.5
    EricWu, 20170406
    To RC4 algo., add Progress function. If you need get progress, should input a callback function, I will set progress to this function.

V1.2.6
    EricWu, 20170406
    To BASE64 algo., add Progress function, just like RC4 algo. has been done.
    Will not add progress to MD5 and other hash algo.s. 

V1.2.7
    EricWu, 20170504
    Add DES algo. in ECB mode;
    To DES, just support do crypt to string, donot support file;

V1.2.8
    EricWu, 20170513
    To DES, add CBC mode;

V1.2.9
    EricWu, 20170513
    Add DES3 Ecb mode;

V1.2.10
    EricWu, 20170516
    To DES3, CBC mode supported, and unit test being done.
