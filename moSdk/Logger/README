V1.0.0:
	Create this project for logging.
	This will output a so library;
	This library depends on libMoIniParser.so to parse ini file;
	Currently, support logout to stdout, and logout to file;
	In my design, just can use one config file with all processes once;
	I will use config file named "moLoggerConf.ini", when init, you should input a directory path, and this config file must be exist in this dir.
