V1.0.0:
	Create this project for logging.
	This will output a so library;
	This library depends on libMoIniParser.so to parse ini file;
	Currently, support logout to stdout, and logout to file;
	In my design, just can use one config file with all processes once;
	I will use config file named "moLoggerConf.ini", when init, you should input a directory path, and this config file must be exist in this dir.

V1.0.1:

    Canbe used in multi processes, but just allow one config file!
    If one process has been init succeed, the other process call init, then if they have same config file, it will return OK, and can be used;
